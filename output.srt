1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,090
Do you see this?

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,011
What's happening here?

3
00:00:02,271 --> 00:00:06,615
That's a hint that the photo finish system at the Olympics isn't actually giving us a photo.

4
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:08,016
And that's why it looks a little weird.

5
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:15,563
So these two runners, Kashane Thompson and Noah Lyles, both finished the hundred meter race with an official time of nine point seven nine seconds.

6
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:22,270
The announcer had called it for Thompson, but it turned out his torso crossed that line five thousandths of a second after Lyles.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,551
How do they know that?

8
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:30,456
Well, Omega, which is the official timekeeper for the Olympics, has a finish line camera that can capture forty thousand frames per second.

9
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:33,459
But instead of a normal camera, it scans one vertical slice.

10
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:43,047
So this photo finish picture isn't capturing a moment in time, it's capturing a place, the finish line, and what each body part of each runner looked like as they were crossing it.

11
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:50,033
Those vertical slices are then spread out horizontally by their time code so that the operator can mark their chests with a red line.

12
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:57,382
The ground is white because this camera is only capturing the finish line, and the logos come from a billboard that only the finish line camera can read.
